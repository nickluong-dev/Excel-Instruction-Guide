# Why use pivot tables?

Pivot tables are powerful because they are easy to use. It is used to sort and organize data so that you can draw meaning from the numbers in your dataset.

Pivot Tables make it easy to:

* sort data.
* group data.
* count occurences.
* sum and average data.
* transform rows into columns and columns into rows.
* perform advanced calculations on numbers.

Doing all of these things without a pivot table in Excel is possible, but it's much more time consuming, tedious, and requires more in-depth knowledge.

## When would you use a pivot table?

But what are the practical uses for a pivot table? Consider this receipt from a pizza store:

<img src="https://github.com/nickluong-dev/Excel-Instruction-Guide/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Pizza-Receipt.png?raw=true" alt="Pizza Receipt" height=400px>

A pizza store prints this receipt and logs the information. Hypothetically the owner could gather all of this data and perform some analysis on it. Let's tabularize some of this info:

| Employee      | Date/Time         | Pizza     | Total |
| ------------- |:------------------| :-------- | :---- |
| John          | 2020/01/05 12:01PM| Pepperoni | $8.59 |

Now imagine the owner populates a spreadsheet with hundreds or thousands of receipt data. What is some meaningful information we could gather?

* What is the most popular pizza?
* Which employee sold the most pizzas?
* What time window is the most popular for sales?
* What are hourly and daily sales?
* What are the sale counts of each pizza?

Now that you understand what kind of information we can gather, let's move on to [making your first pivot table and pivot chart.]()
