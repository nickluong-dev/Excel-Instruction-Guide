# Your First Pivot Table

Before you begin, make sure you are using the [sample student dataset]() to follow along.

**1.** Make sure at least one cell of the dataset is highlighted. Navigate to the **Insert** tab and click **PivotTable** on the top right. A prompt will appear for you to select a range for the table. Excel should autopopulate this section for you if you had one cell in teh dataset highlighted. Click **OK**.

**Note:** You can click on **Recommended PivotTables** if you want to quickly make something.
