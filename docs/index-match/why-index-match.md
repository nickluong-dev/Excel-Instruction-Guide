# Why should I use INDEX MATCH?

Many Excel professionals use INDEX MATCH due to multiple advantages it has over a similar function called VLOOKUP.

## Limitations of VLOOKUP

There is an Excel function called VLOOKUP that also allows you to look up data in a table. However, it has a few limitations:

* It can only be used with data that is arranged vertically.

* It is unable to look up and return a value which is to the left of the lookup value.

* It would give you a wrong result if you add/delete a new column in your data.

There are ways around these limitations, but they involve the use of other functions. If you are planning to combine functions, why not use INDEX and MATCH?

## Advantages of INDEX MATCH

INDEX MATCH has some advantages over VLOOKUP which include:

* It can handle data that is arranged vertically and/or horizontally.

* It can look up and return a value which is to the left of the lookup value.

* It can handle row/column numbers if you add/delete new rows/columns from the dataset.

* At worst, INDEX MATCH is about as fast as VLOOKUP. However, there are many cases where it will retrieve data faster when dealing with large amounts of data.

INDEX MATCH has a higher learning curve than VLOOKUP but the advantages are worth it. The next sections will show you how to use INDEX and MATCH.
