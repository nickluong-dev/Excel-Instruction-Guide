# What Are Functions?

A function in excel are predefined formulas that perform calculations in a specific order. This is very powerful as we don't have to implement everything manually and Excel has plenty of them for us! 

As we go along, we will explain any functions used.

Below are some common functions.

| Function      | Description                                                |
| ------------- |:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| SUM           | adds the total of a series of numbers                      |
| AVERAGE       | calculates the average of a series of numbers              |
| PRODUCT       | multiplies all numbers of a series of numbers              |
| IF            | checks if a condition is met and returns True or False     |
| AND           | checks if all conditions are met and returns True or False |
| YEAR          | Extracts the year from a given date (eg. 01/01/2000)       |
