# A brief overview of Excel's GUI

Before we jump into making our first table, chart, and start using functions, let us get familiar with the general layout of Excel and its important buttons.

Here is Excel's toolbar. Currently we are in the <b> Home </b> tab. This is where can format our text and do some basic manipulation.

Notice the **Number** section of the toolbar. This is where you can format your data (eg. percentages, dollars, commas).

The **Cells** section allows you to add, delete, and format rows. For now, you will just be adding and deleting rows.

Currently, we are working in one spreadsheet. The <b>Sheets</b> tab at the bottom allows you to add, delete, and rename any additional sheets you may need.

Here is an overview of the Excel GUI with labels. You will get used to most of these buttons and functions as you progress through the guide.
