# Creating a Table and Charts

There are many applications for Excel like accounting and finance. This instruction set will help you create your first table and charts.

Let's create a simple grocery list.

**1.** Type in these values to start. You can bold the headers by highlight the cells and clicking on the **B** button. Right now we have left total blank.

**2.** Highlight Column B by click on the **B column.**  We want to make these dollars, so click on the **$** symbol under the numbers section.

**3.** Now, calculate the total. Use the **SUM** function. Click on the cell, and type `=SUM()`. Highlight the costs by holding **Shift** on your keyboard and clicking cell **B2** then **B5**. Press **Enter** on your keyboard to get the sum! 

You can do other things like calculate the average price by following this procedure.

**4.** Highlight the entire table by Shift-Clicking cells A1 to B6. Navigate to the **Insert** tab and click **Insert Table**. Click **Ok** on the prompt. Now we have a table where we can sort and filter data.

**5.** Click on the drop down arrow on the **Cost** header. Click on **Sort Smallest to Largest**. Now our prices are sorted. 

You can perform other actions like filtering your numbers using equations.

**6.** With the table highlighted, navigate to the **Recommended Charts** button. Choose a graph of your choice.

Excel recommends the most applicable chart, but you can choose whichever graph make sense to you. Besides the **Recommended Charts** button are smaller icons for the various graphs available. For this example, we will use a pie chart.

**7.** Click on your graph. Click on the **Chart Elements**  button, check **Data Values** and choose where you want it to appear. By default, Excel does not show the data values.
