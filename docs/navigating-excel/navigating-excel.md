This guide expects users to have some experience with Microsoft office already. If you have worked with Word or Powerpoint, then Excel's GUI will not be too different.

This section will cover some of the basics like making insert a chart. We will explore some basic functions that excel offers and create your first table.

## Before We Start - GUI

Before we jump into making our first table, chart, and start using functions, let us get familiar with the general layout of Excel and it's important buttons.

Here is Excel's toolbar. Currently we are in the <b> Home </b> tab. This is where can format our text and do some basic manipulation.

Notice the **Number** section of the toolbar. This is where you can format your data (eg. percentages, dollars, commas).

The **Cells** section allows you to add, delete, and format rows. For now, you will just be adding and deleting rows.

Currently, we are working in one spreadsheet. The <b>Sheets</b> tab at the bottom allows you to add, delete, and rename any additional sheets you may need.

Here is an overview of the Excel GUI with labels. You will get used to most of these buttons and functions as you progress through the guide.

For now, the main areas you will be using are the **Rows, Columns, Active Cell, Toolbar Ribbon.**

## What Are Functions?

A function in excel are predefined formulas that perform calculations in a specific order. This is very powerful as we don't have to implement everything manually and Excel has plenty of them for us! 

As we go along, we will explain any functions used.

Below are some common functions.

| Function      | Description                                                |
| ------------- |:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| SUM           | adds the total of a series of numbers                      |
| AVERAGE       | calculates the average of a series of numbers              |
| PRODUCT       | multiplies all numbers of a series of numbers              |
| IF            | checks if a condition is met and returns True or False     |
| AND           | checks if all conditions are met and returns True or False |
| YEAR          | Extracts the year from a given date (eg. 01/01/2000)       |

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list. Refer to the official Microsoft list of built-in functions [here.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/excel-functions-alphabetical-b3944572-255d-4efb-bb96-c6d90033e188)
