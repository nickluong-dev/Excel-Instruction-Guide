# Troubleshooting

| Error                       | Action to Take  |
|:----------------------------|:----------------|
| Target cells are not affected by conditional formatting | Ensure all of your target cells were highlighted before applying conditional formatting. Then, ensure that the data in your selected cells fall into the range you have set for your conditional formatting. |
| PivotTable Fields tab does not appear | Navigate to the **[PivotTable Analyze]** tab and click **[Field List]** |
| My MATCH function returns the value #N/A | Ensure that only cells from one single row or one single column have been selected as the second parameter |
| Recorded macro does not appear in list of available macros | Macros are saved by worksheet to worksheet basis. After recording a macro, remember to save the sheet as this will automatically save the macro. This also means that the macro will not appear on other worksheets unless you have the worksheet you saved the macro to open.
